1. Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it:

	10
      /	  \
     9     8
    / \   / \
   6   5 7   4
  / \  /
 2   1 3

		
	11
       /  \
      10   8
     /  \  / \
    6    9 7  4
   / \	 /\
  2   1  3 5

2. Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node.

	9
       / \
      6   8
     / \  /\
    3   5 7 4
   / \ 
  2   1 

3. Imagine you've build a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what orders would the numbers would the numbers now appear?

they would be in ascending order or descending order
depending on the type of the heap.
