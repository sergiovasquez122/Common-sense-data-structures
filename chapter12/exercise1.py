1. The following function accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum,
as long as a particular number doesnâ€™t bring the sum above 100. If adding
a particular number will make the sum higher than 100, that number is
ignored. However, this function makes unnecessary recursive calls. Fix
the code to eliminate the unnecessary recursion:
