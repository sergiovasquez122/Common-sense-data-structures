'''
1. Given an array of positive numbers, write a function that returns the
greatest product of any three numbers. The approach of using three
nested loops would clock in at O(N 3 ), which is very slow. Use sorting to
implement the function in a way that it computes at O(N log N) speed.
(There are even faster implementations, but weâ€™re focusing on using
sorting as a technique to make code faster.)
