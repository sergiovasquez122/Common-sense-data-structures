1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered, array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]

Three scans after done before the 4th scan retrieves the necessary element. Thus in total, 4 steps are needed.

2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?

1 step is needed. The middle index turns out the be the required element in the first iteration.

3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on array of size 100,000

floor(log2(100000)) + 1 = 17

in total, 17 steps are needed.
