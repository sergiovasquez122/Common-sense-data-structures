4. In the text I demonstrated how to use inorder traversal to print a list of
all the book titles. Another way to traverse a tree is known as preorder
traversal. Here is the code for it as applied to our book app:
def traverse_and_print(node):
	if node is None:
		return
	print(node.value)
	traverse_and_print(node.leftChild)
	traverse_and_print(node.rightChild)

For the example tree in the text (the one with Moby Dick and the other
book titles), write out the order in which the book titles are printed with
preorder traversal.

'Moby Dick' -> 'Great Expectations' -> 'Alice In Wonderland' -> 'Lord of the Flies' -> 'Robinson Crusoe' -> 'Pride and Prejudice' -> 'The Odyssey'
