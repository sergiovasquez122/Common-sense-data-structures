5. There is yet another form of traversal called postorder traversal. Here is
the code as applied to our book app:
def traverse_and_print(node):
if node is None:
return
traverse_and_print(node.leftChild)
traverse_and_print(node.rightChild)
print(node.value)
For the example tree in the text (which also appears in the previous
exercise), write out the order in which the book titles are printed with
postorder traversal.

'Alice In Wonderland' -> 'Lord of the Flies' -> 'Great Expecations' -> 'Pride and Prejudice' -> 'The Odyssey' -> 'Robinson Crusoe' -> 'Moby Dick'
