1. If you were writing software for a call center that places callers on hold and then assigns them to 'the next available representative,' would you use a stack or a queue?

I would use a queue.

2. If you pushed numbers onto a stack in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then popped two items, which number would you be able to read from the stack?

last in first out so 6 would be the first element to be read.

3. If you inserted numbers into a queue in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then dequeued two items, which number would you be able to read from the queue?

first in first out, so 3 would be the answer.

4. Write a function that uses a stack to reverse a string, you can work with our earlier implementation of the Stack class.

def reverse_string(A):
	l = []
	for c in A:
		l.append(c)
	result = ""
	while len(l) != 0:
		result += l.pop()
	return result
